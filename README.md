Useful links: [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) | [Easy Permissions API](https://github.com/googlesamples/easypermissions)

This app first makes use of the Dark Sky Weather API, to get information on the weather. This weather api is rather impressiver there is a tremendous amount of data available. A request returns the current condidion, hourly, daily, minutely, astronomical, alerts, and more that I can not list. 

Second, this app makes use of the Easy Permissions API, a simple api that makes asking for permissions on devices, especially Android v 6.0 >.
